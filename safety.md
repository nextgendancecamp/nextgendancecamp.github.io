# Safety and Consent Agreement

I will respect my fellow campers regardless of dance skill and background, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, etc.

I will respect the physical and personal boundaries of my fellow campers both on and off the dance floor.

I am empowered to inform fellow campers if something they do makes me uncomfortable or physically hurts me.

I will respect fellow campersâ€™ requests to stop doing something that makes them uncomfortable or physically hurts them.

I am free to accept and decline dances for whatever reasons I wish. I am not obliged to provide any explanation. As the requester, I will respect the wishes of someone who declines my request.

I will do my best not to step on, bump, or trip other dancers. I will not attempt dance moves (such as aerials, lifts, or large movements) if they are potentially dangerous to my partner, the dancers around me, or myself.

I will bring inappropriate actions that I personally experience or observe to the attention of the organizers.

Actions that compromise the safe and respectful environment of this event are not acceptable from any member of our community, be they attendees, teachers, performers, volunteers, or organizers.
