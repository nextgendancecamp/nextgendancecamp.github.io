## Thanks for making Next Gen Dance Camp 2018 a success!  Our next event will be October 2-4, 2020. Stay tuned for details!

### What is this event?

This is a three-day residential contra dance camp. You can get a sense of what it's like by looking at our [2018 performers and schedule](/2018.html).

### Who is this event for?

You! Self-identified youth and youth-allied individuals welcome. We will not exclude any dancers due to age. We are a youth-organized and youth-focused event, and welcome attendees who promote our vision of empowering youth involvement in the folk community.

Who we are not: An exclusive cool hip dancer clique checking IDs at the door. We are also not affiliated with Youth Dance Weekend (YDW), although they have generously provided us with a lot of advice!

To help make camp safe and welcoming for everyone, please read our [safety agreement](/safety.html).


### What role terms will you be using?

All dances are called using Larks and Ravens.  We firmly believe that any person can dance any role, and we want our use of language to reflect that.  You can read more about why we made this choice  [here](/larks_and_ravens.html).

### Where?

The Kiwanis Camp, which is familiar to those of you who have attended Northwest Passage. The location is spectacular: halfway up Mt. Hood. As you will need a vehicle to get to camp, we’ll be helping coordinate ride-shares from Portland, which is the nearest major city, as well as from other PNW locales. We’ll sleep in shared heated cabins. Catering will be able to accommodate most dietary requirements. We will do our best to make the event [fragrance free](/fragrance_free.html).

### How does housing work?

Kiwanis camp has heated cabins broken up into rooms that house 4-10 people.  We default to not gender-designating rooms; in 2018 there was one gender designated room by request.  Most bathrooms will be gender-neutral, but we designate one men's and one women's bathroom with showers, and there are a few single occupancy restrooms and showers at camp.

### Cost?

Because we want this event to be available to everyone, NextGen has a sliding scale. You decide how much makes sense for your financial situation.  We provide suggestions, but campers are welcome to pay anything above our minimum ($125 in 2018).  If the minimum really doesn't work for you and you're still interested in coming, please contact us at contact@nextgendancecamp.org.

Please take our suggestions as a guide and not a rule.  We're committed to making this camp as affordable as possible to anyone who wants to come, and you know more about your financial situation than we do.  But please also remember that in order to make camp financially sustainable, we need some people to pay more than the break-even price.

### Refund Policy

When you sign up, we plan for your presence both financially and in terms of all the supplies we'll need to buy or have to wrangle for camp, so if it turns out you can't come, please tell us as soon as possible!  If you cancel before the refund policy, we'll refund anything you paid minus $15.  If you cancel after the refund deadline, we won't generally offer refunds.  However, we understand that things can change suddenly and camp is expensive, so if you have extenuating circumstances, let us know and we'll consider making an exception.

### Is this a science fiction themed event?

No, just a contra dance camp organized by nerds.  Our science fiction fandoms won't play a role in the weekend more substantial than our choice of website aesthetics and registration dates.

### More Questions?
If you have other questions please feel free to email us at contact@nextgendancecamp.org


### Acknowledgments
We’d like to acknowledge the Portland Country Dance Community (PCDC), which generously provided us with both a starter grant and loan.
