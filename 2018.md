Jesse Partridge (Riffraff, Contra Quartet), Amy Englesberg (Free Raisins, Wake Up Robin), and Alex Sturbaum (Countercurrent, Gallimaufry) formed the Waxwings on a lark in 2016, and since then have been playing sweet, sultry, and stomping tunes throughout the Northwest. The Waxwings combine a sweet and lyrical fiddler with two powerhouse rhythm players who double as accordionists. Their joyful, pulsating sounds impel you to defy gravity with every step.
